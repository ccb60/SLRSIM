Description: SLRSIM offers tools to facilitate analysis of recent sea level
    rise trends and forecasting of future flood frequency under user-specified 
    sea level rise scenarios. The package includes tools to access NOAA tide
    gauge data, examine long-term trends in sea level rise, compare recent sea 
    level rise to previous periods in the data record, and forecast future flood
    frequency based on historical data.
