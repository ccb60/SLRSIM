Description: SLRSIM offers tools to facilitate analysis of recent sea level
             rise trends and forecasting of future flood frequency under 
             user-specified sea level rise scenarios. The package includes 
             tools to access NOAA tide guage data, examine long-term trends
             in sea leve rise, compare recent sea level rise to previous periods
             in the data record, and forecast future flood frequency based on 
             historical data.
