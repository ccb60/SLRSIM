#' @details
#' The Package originated in code developed for the 2020/2021 State of Casco
#' Bay Report. In response to requests from colleagues, I first extended
#' our analysis to a couple of other NOAA tide stations, and then developed this
#' package to capture key ideas and code for reuse.
#'
#' The intent was to offer a collection of tools to facilitate rapid preparation
#' of historical analyses and forecasts principally to facilitate communication
#' about sea level rise to policy makers and the public.
#'
#' Since I first began working on the package, NOAA has begun to release
#' related analyses for many NOAA stations, so the need for the package is less
#' pressing (when workiong with NOAA data), but this package offers the user
#' fine-grained control not available from the prepared analyses offered by
#' NOAA.
