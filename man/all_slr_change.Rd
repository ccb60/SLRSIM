\usage{
all_slr_change(
  .data,
  .sl,
  .dt,
  .span = 20L,
  .interval = if (.mode == "year") 1L else NULL,
  .mode = c("year", "duration", "count"),
  t_fit = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Source data frame for data.  Use NULL if no data frame is used
and all data is passed from
the enclosing environment.}

\item{.sl}{The data variable (usually found in the data frame) showing sea
level or mean sea level.  Must be a named variable, not an
expression.}

\item{.dt}{Data variable containing corresponding midpoint dates for the
period of averaging used to calculate .sl. Must be a named variable,
not an expression. Midpoint dates for a given month can be approximated
with \verb{as.Date(paste(year, month, 15, sep = '-')}.}

\item{.span}{Span defining the "recent" period for fitting the model.
integer or difftime object.  Interpretation of .span depends on the
value of the by_year. If \code{by_year == TRUE}, \code{.span} must be an
integer, and is interpreted as the number of years included in the
"recent" period for fitting the model.  If \code{by_year == FALSE}, and
\code{.span} is an integer, it is interpreted as the number of records to
include in the 'recent' period.}

\item{.interval}{Integer. Spacing of the start of time periods
on which to calculate slopes. For \code{.mode == 'year'}, defaults to 1.
Otherwise, must be provided.}

\item{.mode}{one of c('year', 'time', 'count') indicating whether the .span
is expressed in years, time coordinates, or number of observations.
If \code{.mode == 'year'}, slopes are scaled to be expressed on a per year
basis.  Scaling requires the time coordinate to inherit from R
\code{Date} or \code{POSIXt} objects.  Rates based on \code{Dates} are converted to
annual values by multiplying by 365.2422 days / year.  Rates based on
\code{POSIXt} objects are converted to annual values by multiplying slope
estimates by multiplying by 31556926 seconds / year (with a warning
about rounding error). No scaling is done for \code{.mode == 'time'} or
\code{.mode == 'count'}.}

\item{t_fit}{Should the underlying generalized linear model's correlation
structure be fit based on the time coordinate (.dt), or only on the
sequence of observations in the data? Setting this to TRUE is safer if
you are uncertain of the sequence of observations in the source data,
or significant missing values in the data, but it significantly slows
model fitting.  Results tend to be very similar for complete or near
complete data.}

\description{
Compares the recent rate of sea level rise to rates for all prior periods of
the same length.
}
\details{
A frequent question raised in analysis of recent sea level records is whether
the rate of sea level rise is increasing, as predicted by numerous climate
models over the years. This is a simple question that is rather more complex
to answer statistically than it at first appears.

This function compares the rate of sea level rise in the most recent period
(defined by \code{.span}) to the rate of sea level rise in prior periods of
the same length in the historic record.

This function returns a probability that corresponds to the percentage of
prior evaluates periods with a slope equal to or greater than the most recent
slope.

While conceptually, this is akin to a p-value, with the null hypothesis that
the current period is drawn from the same distribution as all prior slopes,
it should not be interpreted strictly. Consecutive slopes are strongly
auto-correlated. This analysis makes no effort to account for that
autocorrelation.
