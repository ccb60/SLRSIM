# Introduction
The SLRSIM package includes utility functions for accessing NOAA data about 
tidal monitoring stations. This vignette describes what metadata is directly 
exposed, and how to gather further metadata about tidal monitoring stations.

NOaa's tidal monitoting stations are known formally as "Water Level Observation 
Network Stations."

These functions are used by several functions in the package to set up analysis
of historical data and future flood risk assessments, but their primary value to 
users will be to gather descriptive information about each tidal station without
requiring manual search of related NOAA web pages.

## Accessing Datums
We access information on station datums through the NOAA metadata API.
Information on the NOAA APIs is available here:
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/web_services_info.html.

Essentially all metadata accessed via these functions is also accessible
manually from tidal station informational web pages.  The URL for each tidal 
station's home page is readily accessed through a NOAA web page, if you know the 
station ID of the station of interest.  Teh for mof the URL is as follows: 

```
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions.html?XXXXXXX
```
Where XXXXXXX represent the unique seven digit numerical code for the station of
interest.

These functions depend on details of the NOAA tidal data APIs, and so are not 
available for many stations outside the US.  NOAA does provide access to 
data from some international stations through the APIs, but these functions have 
not been tested against international stations.

## A Introduction to Tidal Datums
The term tidal "datum" is often used somewhat imprecisely, so can be confusing 
for people who first access NOAA tidal data.  Here we offer an overview of 
important concepts, as relevant for tidal analysis. This is a complex topic,
and  we provide only a brief overview.  A thorough understanding of 
these topics is essential in several other fields, especially for geographical
information systems and high precision use of GPS technologies.

A datum is an elevation that serves as the "zero value" for elevation (or depth)
measurements. Elevations and depths can be expressed relative to a surprisingly
large number of different conceptual zero values, depending on purpose. 

For example, mariners are usually interested in not running aground, so
navigation charts usually show depths relative to a "worst case scenario" of low
tide. The tidal datum used for charts, therefore is often "mean lower low
water", usually abbreviated as "MLLW". 

Other extreme tidal values are often of interest for other purposes, especially
design of coastal infrastructure, leading to many other possible "zero" 
elevations, including mean low water, mean high water, mean higher high water,
and the highest astronomical tide.

When move away from the immediate coast, we  talk about the height of a
mountain peak in terms of elevation "above sea level".  But what exactly do we
mean by sea level?  The elevation of the surface of the ocean varies. So when we
speak about "sea level", do we mean high tide?  low tide?  some sort of average
tide? This concept leads to several other common tidal datums, including "mean
sea level" and "mean tide level".

Another way to think about "sea level" is that it represents a  gravitational
equipotential surface encircling the globe. (Originally this concept came from
surveying practice, where relative elevations were determined based on
"leveling".) But even here lie layers of complexity.  Because the globe is not
spherical (it is closer to an oblate spheroid), the globe's equipotential
surface is also not expected to be spherical.  So any "equipotential surface"
needs to be based on a model of the shape of the earth.  Now we also know
that variations in the density of the materials in the earth's crust lead to
measurable differences in the strength of earth's gravitational field, so a true
equipotential surface wiggles compared to any smooth geometric model of the
earth.  So, there are a lot of other ways people define the "zero elevation" at
any given point on the globe, depending on which model of the shape of the
earth or its equipotential surface they chose to use.  This kind of logic
leads t oa variety of different elevation reference points, including the 
widely used "NAVD-88", which stands for the National Vertical Datum of 1988.  

More generally, in a surveying, mapping or  GIS context, maps rely on defined
three dimensional coordinate systems, usually tied to a specific datum. Each 
selected coordinate system thus has an implied system of determining elevation. 
Systems in use vary tremendously. GPS and Google Map use WGS 1984 (for the
"World Geodetic System of 1984).  Many map products derived from USGS
topographic maps originally used "Universal Transverse Mercator" projections.
The implied coordinate systems vary based on the date the map was published,
often either NAD 27 (for older maps) or NAD 83 (for more recent maps).

Luckily, most of this complexity is not essential for tidal analysis, as 
only local phenomena are of interest.   The most important idea is that 
elevations can be expressed in many different ways, and yo uneed to be able to 
translate correctly among them.

For a deeper discussion of these ideas, se
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datum_options.html

## Tidal Statistics
NOAA publishes a variety of statistics about local tidal regimes along with
information on the tidal datum, which can lead to some confusion. Tidal 
statistics are generally calculated based on the same data and models as the 
tidal datums (*sensu stricto*) but they are not really datums at all. 
Important tidal statistics include:
*  Measures of the tidal range,  
*  Measures of the difference in height between the two successive high
   or two successive low tides (for semi-diurnal tides)
*  The relative timing of local high and low tides.

The package  provide access to some of these tidal statistics as well, since the 
come "for free" once you access NOAA's on-line tidal metadata.

## Tidal Stations
NOAA maintains numerous primary tidal monitoring stations around
the  coast of the U.S. At these stations, NOAA has collected tidal elevation 
data, usually every six minutes (10 times an hour) for periods in excess of 19
years (one "Tidal Epoch").  This allows formal development of the complex 
harmonic models that generate astronomical tidal predictions.

NOAA also provides tidal predictions for secondary and tertiary stations, based 
on shorter-term data collections. The data collection at the subsidiary 
stations are aimed principally at understanding how tidal dynamics differ 
from those observed at nearby primary station, allowing local corrections.

Most analyses implemented in this package require the long-term tidal data from 
primary stations. Some metadata may be available for secondary and tertiary
stations, but these functions have not been tested against subsidiary stations.

Many functions in this package, especially those retrieving data and metadata
from NOAA APIs, require identification of a target tidal station. In the
US, NOAA primary tidal stations are all given a unique seven digit integer code
(as are most or all of the secondary and tertiary locations).

NOAA primary tidal stations that provide data sufficient to conduct the
analyses included here can be looked up by list or map interface here:

# Basic Access Function
We demonstrate `get_datums()` the basic tidal datums access function, by 
retrieving data for the Portland, Maine station. The call returns a named list
of available datum and tidal statistics.  This contents of the list may vary 
for other tidal stations.  We unlist the list here to simplify the display.
```{r}
portland_id <- 8418150 
portland_datums <- get_datums(portland_id)
unlist(portland_datums)
```

The API provides limited descriptions of the meanings of these names, reproduced
here for convenience.

Note "STND", the "Station Datum".  This is an arbitrary zero point defined for
each station.  It's primary value is that all observations and datums can be 
expressed as positive values relative to the station datum.

Usually, userS (and our functions) will need only one or two of these at a time.
Often the useage pattern is to extract the full list oF datums and extract the
values needed using typical R extractor functions. You will normally extract
these components with `$`, but sometimes `[[]]` is conveient, especiallty in
a programming context.

```{r}
portland_datums$MLLW
portland_datums$MSL
portland_datums[['MHW']]
portland_datums[['NAVD88']]
```
### Datum Conversions
It is often convenient to express one datum in terms of another, or convert data 
from one datum to another. With the datum information provided by `get_datums()`,
that is just a matter of subtraction.

It's easy to get confused converting elevations and depths. Just think
carefully about whether a converted value should be lower or higher than before
the conversion, and yo ushuld get the sign of the conversion right.

#### Mythical Tidal Cross Section Data
In supporting CBEP's work on tidal marsh restoration, We often collect data on
the tidal channel cross sections in salt marshes. Channel morphology often
evolves after tidal restoration, and tracking the shape of the channel
helps us understand how the marsh is responding to altered hydrology.

We usually collect that data in NADV88, because that is usually the reference
frame of any nearby benchmarks, but we want to understand channel dynamics in
terms of tidal processes, so we may want to compare those observations to MSL or
MLLW.

Typical cross section data looks something like this, with elevations expressed
in NAVD 1988):
```{r}
xsect_data <- tribble(~Distance, ~Elevation,
        10, 1.25,
        11, 1.26,
        12, 1.24,
        13, 1.22,
        14, 1.20,
        15, 1.1,
        16, 1.0,
        16.5, - .75,
        17, -.85,
        17.5, -.75,
        18,   -0.65,
        18.5, -0.1,
        19,  0.5,
        20, 1,
        21, 1.2,
        22, 1.25
        )
```

```{r fig.height = 2.5, fi.width = 5}
plt = ggplot(xsect_data, aes(x = Distance, y = Elevation)) + 
  geom_line() +
  coord_equal()

plt +
   geom_hline(yintercept = 0 , lty = 2) +
  annotate('text', label = 'NAVD88', x = 11, y = 0.3, size = 3)
```

For tidal interpretation, we reexpress those tidal heights in comparison to 
tidal datums.

```{r}
MHW_as_NAVD88 <- portland_datums$MHW - portland_datums$NAVD88
MLLW_as_NAVD88 <- portland_datums$MLLW - portland_datums$NAVD88
```


```{r fig.height = 2.5, fi.width = 5}
plt + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = MHW_as_NAVD88 , lty = 2) +
  annotate('text', label = 'MHW', x = 11, y = MHW_as_NAVD88 + 0.3, size =3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = MLLW_as_NAVD88 , lty = 3) +
  annotate('text', label = 'MLLW', x = 11, y = MLLW_as_NAVD88 + 0.3, size = 3)
```
Maine tidal marshes often show a high marsh plateau that corresponds roughly to
mean high water.  This graphic reveals how channel elevations climb to that
marsh plateau gradually on either side of the channel.

It also shows that the bottom of the tidal channel -- at this location -- lies
well above the elevation of mean lower low water, a common feature of real tidal
channels.  Tidal marsh channels evolve via sediment transport, just as
freshwater streams do, with sediment transported by flowing water. Mean Lower
Low Water provides a "base elevation" for evolution of those channels, so most
of the channel is "uphill" of MLLW, allowing  water (and desiment) to flow
downstream to the ocean.

# Specialized Extractor Functions
For a variety of reasons, we often want to pull a particular datum, expressed in 
terms of another datum, `SLRSIM` includes a few specialized extractor functions 
for this purpose.

These functions issue a call to the NOAA API, and so, to be polite, they should 
not be placed inside a loop, where they will access the API repeatedly to 
extract the same information.  Extract the data you need once, before any
loops.

(In future, we may create a hidden internal data structure to save results of
the initial call to the NOAA API to avoid unnecessary duplicate calls).

The `SLRSIM` package often uses the concept of the "Highest Astronomical Tide"
to establish a rational basis for default local tidal flooding level.
The HAT value represents the highest predicted tide of a 19 year tidal epoch.
As such, it is a rare, but expected event. Most infrastructure is built (either
due to formal analysis or in response to prior flooding) to not flood (much) at 
the HAT elevation.

## The `get_hat()` Function
A function for extracting HAT is therefore convenient.
```{r}
portland_id <- 8418150 
get_hat(portland_id)                   # 2.134, with a warning
get_hat(portland_id, .base = 'MSL')    # 2.134, no warning
get_hat(portland_id, .base = 'MLLW')   # 3.64
```

# The Tidal Epoch
The astronomical alignment of earth, moon, and sun that generate the tides 
repeats (with good precision) every nineteen years.  Tidal forecasts, therefore,
are based on a nineteen year data set.  That data set is analyzed to
extract "harmonic constituents" used in turn to generate predictions of future
tides.

The nineteen year period over which data was collected to generate the current 
tidal forecasts is known as the "tidal epoch."  For most NOAA tide 
stations, the current tidal epoch ran from 1983 through 2001. 


## The `get_epoch()` Function
The `getepoch()` function accesses the NOAA API, and extracts the tidal epoch
from the data structure returned by that call. As it also is based on another
API call, it should not be called repeatedly.  Call it once, and save the data
you need.


```{r}
portland_epoch <- get_epoch(portland_id)
portland_epoch
```

An That is decidedly problematic in an era of climate change and rising seas, as
predictions are now "off" buy however much sea level rise has occurred since 
2001.

For a few stations with "anomalously high" sea level rise rates -- especially in
the western Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, a modified procedure has been used, that
corrects predictions based on more recent observations, usually from 2012 
through 2016.

Grand Isle, Louisiana is one of the locations where forecasts have been
corrected.  When you place an API call to the NOAA metadata, you are given the 
period over which data was collected for the correction, not for the full
19 year period 
```{r}
grand_isle_id =  8761724
grand_isle_epoch <- get_epoch(grand_isle_id)
grand_isle_epoch
```

NOAA has announced that a new tidal epoch (based on data from 2002 - 2020) will be rolled 
out for tide predictions and calculation of tidal datums, with release expected 
some time in 2025.
